			<Description> 
The experimental release of Never Alone, a mod inspired by Project Zomboid.
You are surrounded by a never ending horde and you have no hope for survival. 
Maybe you can take on the giant skyscrapers in the distance before they finally overtake you, or maybe not ... 

- Built in Rogue-Like respawn mechanics make down time between lives short to keep you in the fight more, and maybe you will find the base of a past life to give yourself a boost. 
- Wandering hordes are frequent and large 
- POIs are infested and dangerous to enter 
- Nights and interiors are very dark to enhance the danger
- Even the trash on the ground can cause you pain if not careful

Recommendations
- Must have Shadow Distance (Settings: Quality) set to at least Low for proper experience
- Jog or Walk speed as PZ is influenced by Romero and thus the difficulty comes from the numbers not the speed
- First time playing choose a difficulty one step below your normal difficulty. This is a challenging mod that will take some adjusting of strategies
- Randomly generate a new world, anything bigger than 5k should have all 4 skyscrapers for you to attempt the final goals and will have the custom RWG
- Some (most) players may benifit from adding the mod "Torch" by Laydor2 available on Nexus. This optimizes the lighting engine using DX11. (https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/3287)
