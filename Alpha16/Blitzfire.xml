			<Description>Nomad Mod v1.0 for 7 Days to Die

This is the initial release of my new Nomad Mod to the public.

In the initial release crafting is mostly removed from the game. You can craft bandages and bedrolls. You can assemble guns and repair items.

Everything else must be looted or bought at a large markup from the traders.
