Book I: Blight.

For a thousand years, humans have believed the myths and legend of old to be just that... legend. Until now. A blight is spreading. Goblin and Orc raiders are traveling to your lands, killing, stealing, and ... bringing something else.

The land itself is falling prey to the mystical evil that follows these foul creatures. Structures cannot be built, trees die, and the land infertile. You were in jail for a small "misunderstanding" between you and the owner of the sheep you ate, but now you're free and you need to defend your homeland against these invaders.

7 Days to Die - Medieval Mod, Book I: Blight is a near total conversion of 7 Days to Die. We have brought in new assets, new sounds, new code, and new features never seen before in a 7 Days to Die mod. 

Book I is a quest based mod, but more importantly, mostly a proof of concept. We recognize the benefit that A17 will bring to the mod so have shortened the development time to get a release out as a test run. This mod is NOT designed for extended play, although it should be possible. We have included a number of new features, from quest-driven exploration of underground ruins to custom spawning and random world generation dictation. There are a number of behind the scene events taking place that replace the core vanilla system, and we are using Book I to test these systems.
