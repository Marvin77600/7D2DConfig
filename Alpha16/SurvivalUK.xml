         <Description>Very simply it balances out the grinding and fun sucking defaults of A16 (imo). A16 really is about the race to get steel tools as the material bonuses and points increases while using them are significant. As before i recommend increasing Z spawns to take advantage of the mod. 

The mod i created really for personal use and i'll keep it up to date as A16 progresses but it's really tailored for fun while not being too grinding. I make no apologies for making things easier to attain and progress quickened. Play vanilla if you're a sadist! </Description>
