Gnamod World Ultra Nomad Mode is a standalone modification of my Gnamod World mod. This mod creates a unique game mode I also 
created previously for alpha 14 that I call the Ultra Nomad Mode. This is a game mode that forces a challenging nomadic playstyle 
where you are armed by a randomized starting kit and have to survive for as long as you can alone, with friends or even against them.

			<Description>
Gnamod Necropolis is a NEW RWG World created using the knowledge gained when I was working on Gnamod World and Ultra Nomad Mode. 
It creates an all new world that features a bleak and desolate post apocalyptic wasteland world. In this world you will not find 
any green biomes or places to hide. You find yourself in the remains of sprawling metropolis, a zone that is not consumed by the 
radiation that surrounds it. The weather has been affected and so have its inhabitants, which come out of their radiation 
hideouts at night to feed on any remaining survivors. 

Can you survive in this Wasteland?

Gnamod Necropolis is a NEW RWG World created using the knowledge gained when I was working on Gnamod World and Ultra Nomad Mode. 
It creates an all new world that features a bleak and desolate post apocalyptic wasteland world. In this world you will not find 
any green biomes or places to hide. You find yourself in the remains of sprawling metropolis, a zone that is not consumed by the 
radiation that surrounds it. The weather has been affected and so have its inhabitants, which come out of their radiation 
hideouts at night to feed on any remaining survivors.
