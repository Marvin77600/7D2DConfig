Welcome to Joke Mod!
This mod is about 85% a joke, 10% serious, 5% butterscotch ripple. It has been an idea for years and is finally a realization. It literally started as a joke and grew from there. The mod has been made so that players can have a serious playthrough and not just log in for 5 minutes, have some laughs, and never play it again. Although some people might still do that. Rude!

This mod was thought up/created by RizzoMF and Zilox with consultation from Khaine and killerbunny264. Thanks also to our testers Dobbers, Jbirdgaming_, hijarl, darkness_from_above, Ecktos, peachykeen80, and RedDaBoo. Also, a big thank you to my community for the ideas and support!
