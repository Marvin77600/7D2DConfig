Gnamod Core nearly has all changes related to gameplay, world creation and includes all assets, textures, icons, and patches required for the mod to function. Gnamod UI contains the user interface mod and its required files. This mod can be used with the base game without Gnamod Core. Both are required to be installed to play Gnamod or any of its add-on modes described in the following paragraphs. The mod launcher installations and manual download zip files will also include additional mods that are optional and will be disabled by default. Some of these are small optional alterations while others are game modes that alter how the mod is played.\r\n\r\nJoin the Gnamod Discord: https://discord.gg/UrQYp7UVP2\r\n-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=FEATURES=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-\r\n=> Entity Stat Randomization: Zombies and Animals in Gnamod have their stats randomized, this includes HP, Speed, Damage, Size, Walktype and Appearance. This makes zombies challenging and interesting as you never really known beforehand what you are dealing with.\r\n\r\n=> Zombie Groups and Classes: The following groups exist: World, Sleeper, Horde, Bloodmoon, Radiated and Radsleeper. Groups are super types that dictate the zombie’s final power and where they will be encountered. Then there are zombie classes, which dictate their behavior and their abilities. The following classes exist: Dasher, Mook, Grunt, Average, Strong, Climber, Puker, Feral, Boss, Volatile and Bomber. Dasher is fast but weak. Mook, Grunt, Average, Strong, are all regular but stronger as you go up. Climbers walk on all fours and jump around. Pukers launch corrosive acid projectiles. Ferals are stronger and faster. Bosses are slower but puke multiple corrosive acid projectiles and they are much stronger. Volatile and Bomber both can explode, but Bombers also act like Climbers.\r\n\r\n=> Animal Behavior Templates: There are templates that animals can extend from giving them a certain behavior. Currently there is Timid, Weary, Neutral, Dangerous, Hostile and Undead. Timid animals will never fight, Weary animals have heightened senses and will not fight unless cornered, Neutral animals will mostly move away if you get close but engage when they are threatened, Dangerous animals have lowered senses but will always engage when something gets in their sights, Hostile animals have heightened senses and actively engage. Undead animals are considered zombies and will only attack the player and non-zombie animals, they will never give up pursuit unless they lose sight.\r\n\r\n=> Overhauled Spawning: Gamestaging, Biome Spawns, Wandering Hordes, Sleepers and Bloodmoons have all been redone for Gnamod. On average there are a lot more zombies in the world and more at night. In cities the number of zombies is higher, especially in the more urban areas. Biomes affect what can spawn, with forest being the easiest and wasteland the hardest. Living animals only spawn in the wilderness, in cities you can encounter zombie animals instead. Wandering Hordes and Bloodmoon Hordes are gamestaged and have waves of zombies mixed with animals. There are no specific ‘Screamer’ zombies in Gnamod, heat made by player activity will attract normal zombies and this will intensify as the gamestage rises.\r\n\r\n=> Resource Overhaul: Gnamod completely overhauls the resource system and adds a load of new resource items in various categories. Gnamod distinguishes the following resource categories: Mineral, Harvest, Junk, Resource, Material and Component. Mineral includes mined or dug up resources such as ores, soils, and stones. Harvest includes harvested resources from natural sources such as plants, trees and, animals. Junk includes anything that pretty much has limited value to crafting and mostly can just be scrapped or sold. Resource includes manufactured items that can be looted, crafted, or obtained from disassembly. Material includes building materials, usually made from various raw resources. Component includes specific resources used in the crafting of ammunition items. Gnamod currently has over 190+ resource items.\r\n\r\n=> Weapon/Firearm Parts: All firearms, tools, melee, and ranged weapons have been redone for Gnamod and now come with parts you need to collect to make them work. Firearms and motorized tools consist of 5 parts that include the weapon itself while tools, melee, and ranged weapons generally consist of 3 or less parts. These weapon parts function like the A16 system where you assembled a weapon from parts and have quality as well. Broken and makeshift parts also exist that either need to be replaced or make the weapon function poorly. While looting or trading you can find these with parts attached or find the parts separately.\r\n\r\n=> Ammunition Overhaul: Firearm ammunition has been reworked to add more different calibers. The following ammo now exists: .22 LR, .38 SP, .45 ACP, 9mm, 5.56mm, 7.62mm, .44 Mag, .500 Mag, 30.06, .50BMG, 20 GA, 12 GA and 10 GA. Each of these calibers also has a HP and AP version (these are slugs for Shotguns), and each has 3 quality levels: Reloaded, Normal and Pristine. For this, new components were added as well, split into small, medium, large, and shell.\r\n\r\n=> Firearms: Firearms have been redone, with 4 distinct versions of each type (Pistol, Rifle, Assault, and Shotgun). Each has 3 different calibers to choose from as well. \r\n\r\n=> Bows/Crossbows: Bows and Crossbows have been redone as well as arrows and bolts that now come in more different materials: Wood, Stone, Bone, Scrap, Iron, Steel and Titanium. \r\n\r\n=> Melee/Tools: Melee weapons and tools have been redone, Axes, Picks and Shovels are now decent weapons alongside their tool use and melee weapons have been grouped into Clubs, Blades, Spears, Sledges, and Fists. Stun baton is now a unique club while the torch and flashlight are both usable as clubs. \r\n\r\n=> Schematic Perks: Reworked Schematics and added Perks to keep track of unlocked technology. Normal perks will no longer unlock anything but the most basic level of a related technology. This means finding or buying technology is more important. Some of these perks allow spending precious perk points to increase their level.\r\n\r\n=> Progression Overhaul: The experience curve has been adjusted and there is a soft level cap of 100 where no skill points can be earned from gaining new levels. The maximum amount of skill points from levels is 134 and currently 5 additional points are earned from the starter story. Eventually the maximum points will be 150 once the progression overhaul has been completed.\r\n\r\n=> New Perks: Lucky Looter no longer offers a flat bonus to lootstage, it can only increase as much as the player’s current level. Added a new perk: Bring it On, which increases all gamestage to increase challenge but also increased looting.\r\n\r\n=> Workstation Overhaul: Workstations have been overhauled and each now has two levels of complexity. The first level of each can be crafted as soon as you get access to a Claw Hammer and then use it to construct the Worktable. The Forge does not exist in Gnamod and instead is replaced by the Smelter. The Smelter does not melt resources into it, but instead just transforms raw metals into forged resources. These forged resources can then be further processed into other resources or items. Each workstation has room for up to 3 tools and a lot of items can be a workstation tool. Such tools, such as a saw, can unlock recipes or enhance it by increasing yields, lowering costs, or increasing speeds.\r\n\r\n=> Blueprints: Instead of frames or building blocks directly, Gnamod has Blueprint blocks that appear as blue translucent blocks. These do not support any weight and are not solid. They can be upgraded with the correct construction tool and by having the right material on hand. Currently Blueprints support around 100 shapes but in the future more shapes will be added to this system. There are 10 different materials to build with: Wood, Flagstone, Scrap, Clay Brick, Iron, Granite Brick, Steel, Concrete, Stainless Steel and Hardcrete. The chosen shape will determine the properties and upgrade cost of a block, where the rule is: the lower the volume the cheaper to build but also weaker it is going to be. Stone blocks need to dry before they reach their full strength, have additional HP but have lower damage and explosion resistance than metal blocks. Metal blocks need to be upgraded two times to get to their full strength, giving the option to build cheaper but at decreased strength.\r\n\r\n=> No Magic Upgrades: Upgrading from existing POI blocks is not possible. Those blocks also cannot be repaired, only torn down for their resources. Player build blocks can be upgraded using Blueprints and a build tool. The block will be converted to a new Blueprint block of the same shape of the next best material and can then be filled in or picked up. This does not provide any support to be careful while upgrading supporting blocks.\r\n\r\n=> Legacy Distant Terrain: Sphereii shared the code for this, and it has been included into Gnamod. This means Distant Terrain is drawn as it was in A17. This means it does not only perform a bit better, but it also allows the use of custom biomes and terrain textures. This opens the door to much more interesting worlds.\r\n\r\n=> Overhauled Biomes: All existing biomes have been redone in the Gnamod style. The burnt biome has been repurposed as a grassland biome and the water biomes has been brought back underneath the water. New biomes have been added since A20 and more will be added in the near future to improve the look and feel of RWG worlds.\r\n\r\n=> Overhauled RWG: The world generator also known as RWG has been overhauled with both XML tweaks as well as Harmony scripts. This allows for much more interesting worlds to be generated with snowcapped mountains, height-based biomes and even maps keeping the chosen name rather than getting randomly named. These generator changes allow custom biomes to be placed\r\n\r\n=> Looting Overhaul: Looting in Gnamod uses a system where Quantity scales with lootstage and Quality only scales mildly with lootstage. Quality on certain containers is even completely agnostic of lootstage, meaning level 1 characters have the same chance to find something good in them as max level ones. A lot more blocks, like open versions of containers, are lootable in Gnamod as well as boxes and other blocks that look like they could be opened. \r\n\r\n=> Economics Overhaul: The economics in Gnamod have been rebuild from the ground up, where prices of items depend a lot more on their recipes and how hard they are to craft. Items parts and mods add their value, based on quality, directly to the items. This means low quality items with high quality parts will be worth the sum of them and not have price based on the item only.\r\n\r\n=> Questing Overhaul: Trader quests will award rewards based on Gnamod lootstage and higher tier quests have more and better options to pick from even without specializing in questing. The starter quest will now send you to a nearby POI before sending you to a trader. As reward you will get a guaranteed gun package with bullets or medical items once you do make it to the trader.\r\n\r\n=> Dyes: Gnamod comes with 4913 new dyes to find and use. These dyes cover the whole spectrum of colors so it will be hard to find two copies of the same color. Dyes once applied cannot be removed from an item, so be careful when choosing your item’s color.\r\n\r\n=> Multi-Use Items: Gnamod now has items with multiple uses, currently available as Rations and First Aid Kits. These work from the toolbar only but can be used until their durability runs out. The higher the quality the more uses they have.\r\n\r\n-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+= UI FEATURES=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-\r\n=> HUD: Displays HP/Stamina/Food/Water on bottom left along with buffs above them. On the right xp and ammo is shown with the hotbar above it. Harvest notifications are displayed on the left of this. Messages are displayed middle left just below where chat is.\r\n\r\n=> Compass: Displayed top center, shows the compass and markers as well as stealth as a bar inside the compass. Also displays altitude, time, day and world temperature below the compass.\r\n\r\n=> Backpack: 110 (10x11) Slots with integrated toolbar slots on the top for easy access.\r\n\r\n=> Recipe and Workstation Window: Room for 22 categories, 8x6 recipes that can be shown in a grid, easy action buttons for crafting and times at the top and 12 crafting slots at the bottom. Unavailable recipes show greyed out. Clear workstation/lock icon visible for recipe entries. Workstations have space for 3 tools, 3 fuel slots (if they use fuel) and 6 output slots. In vanilla the forge also shows 3 input slots along with info on up to 9 melted items.\r\n\r\n=> Recipe Info Window: Shows 4x4 grid of ingredient info, what it is unlocked by and the description.\r\n\r\n=> Item Info Window: Shows up to 8 stats, the item value, the actions it has, description and its icon.\r\n\r\n=> Character Window: Shows the player and equipped slots (armor left, clothes right) and overlays with additional information.\r\n\r\n=> Buff Window: Shows an entry for each buff, up to 16 per page and the information of that buff in a text window.\r\n\r\n=> Map Window: Centered rectangular map taking up most of the screen. Waypoints and shared waypoints are on the left side and the map starts are on the right side. Right click on the map brings up 2 options, Marker in red and Custom in green. Marker places the flagpole on the clicked spot while custom will bring up a choice of icons on the right side of the map. It has room for 13x32 icons and currently loads all available UI icons to choose from.\r\n\r\n=> Quest Window: Takes up enough space to make all the information easily readable. In the center is the quest description, on the right side the objectives and the rewards. On the left side is the list of available quests and a list of quests being shared with buttons to manipulate them.\r\n\r\n=> Journal Window: Shows a journal entry full screen and has tabs for up to 9 of them you can cycle through to read them. Will no longer flash if you have unread entries.\r\n\r\n=> Creative Menu: Room for 22 categories and 22 subcategories and 9x15 items displayed. Items do not show stack info. \r\n\r\n=> Looting and Vehicle Storage Window: Room for containers up to 10x16 slots in size. Transfer and sorting buttons and slot locking to prevent the first x items to be transferred/sorted when using these buttons.\r\n\r\n=> Assemble and Vehicle Window: Room for 10 mods and 1 cosmetic mod, shows stats of the item/vehicle. Vehicle window also shows buttons to repair/refuel.\r\n\r\n=> Electric Windows: Show the info and slots with a bigger font to make it more easily readable. More space for slots and camera preview.\r\n\r\n=> Trader Window: Shows up to 5x6 items in grid and buy information and actions on the top. Has room for up to 22 categories. \r\n\r\n=> Reward Window: Up to 7 different rewards and trader dialog displayed.\r\n\r\n=> Radial Menu: Changed the size of the Radial menu items. More size for the icons and the text is now below and has a bigger font and more space to show. Makes the radial menu easier to operate.\r\n\r\n=> Target Bar: Entity names are displayed when you look at them, so you get some basic insight into what you are fighting. If HP bar is enabled, it will also show an indication of their HP. When godmode is on it will give the exact numbers.\n","IsVanilla":false,"ModSetting":{"downloadSize":1,"currentVersion":"","useEAC":false,"keepUptodate":true,"numberOfBackups":5,"lastShortID":"","lastGamePath":""},"modName":"Gnamod Core (Stable)","installedGameVersion":"","modGroup":"Gnamod","description":"\n===============Current Version 0.9.0.4 Stable (A20.6)===============\r\nGnamod is split into two core mods: Gnamod Core and Gnamod UI.

There are no specific ‘Screamer’ zombies in Gnamod, heat made by player activity will attract normal zombies and this will intensify as the gamestage rises.\r\n\r\n=> Resource Overhaul: Gnamod completely overhauls the resource system and adds a load of new resource items in various categories. Gnamod distinguishes the following resource categories: Mineral, Harvest, Junk, Resource, Material and Component. Mineral includes mined or dug up resources such as ores, soils, and stones. Harvest includes harvested resources from natural sources such as plants, trees and, animals. Junk includes anything that pretty much has limited value to crafting and mostly can just be scrapped or sold. Resource includes manufactured items that can be looted, crafted, or obtained from disassembly. Material includes building materials, usually made from various raw resources. Component includes specific resources used in the crafting of ammunition items. Gnamod currently has over 190+ resource items.\r\n\r\n=> Weapon/Firearm Parts: All firearms, tools, melee, and ranged weapons have been redone for Gnamod and now come with parts you need to collect to make them work. Firearms and motorized tools consist of 5 parts that include the weapon itself while tools, melee, and ranged weapons generally consist of 3 or less parts. These weapon parts function like the A16 system where you assembled a weapon from parts and have quality as well. Broken and makeshift parts also exist that either need to be replaced or make the weapon function poorly. While looting or trading you can find these with parts attached or find the parts separately.\r\n\r\n=> Ammunition Overhaul: Firearm ammunition has been reworked to add more different calibers. The following ammo now exists: .22 LR, .38 SP, .45 ACP, 9mm, 5.56mm, 7.62mm, .44 Mag, .500 Mag, 30.06, .50BMG, 20 GA, 12 GA and 10 GA. Each of these calibers also has a HP and AP version (these are slugs for Shotguns), and each has 3 quality levels: Reloaded, Normal and Pristine. For this, new components were added as well, split into small, medium, large, and shell.\r\n\r\n=> Firearms: Firearms have been redone, with 4 distinct versions of each type (Pistol, Rifle, Assault, and Shotgun). Each has 3 different calibers to choose from as well. \r\n\r\n=> Bows/Crossbows: Bows and Crossbows have been redone as well as arrows and bolts that now come in more different materials: Wood, Stone, Bone, Scrap, Iron, Steel and Titanium. \r\n\r\n=> Melee/Tools: Melee weapons and tools have been redone, Axes, Picks and Shovels are now decent weapons alongside their tool use and melee weapons have been grouped into Clubs, Blades, Spears, Sledges, and Fists. Stun baton is now a unique club while the torch and flashlight are both usable as clubs. \r\n\r\n=> Schematic Perks: Reworked Schematics and added Perks to keep track of unlocked technology. Normal perks will no longer unlock anything but the most basic level of a related technology. This means finding or buying technology is more important. Some of these perks allow spending precious perk points to increase their level.\r\n\r\n=> Progression Overhaul: The experience curve has been adjusted and there is a soft level cap of 100 where no skill points can be earned from gaining new levels. The maximum amount of skill points from levels is 134 and currently 5 additional points are earned from the starter story. Eventually the maximum points will be 150 once the progression overhaul has been completed.\r\n\r\n=> New Perks: Lucky Looter no longer offers a flat bonus to lootstage, it can only increase as much as the player’s current level. Added a new perk: Bring it On, which increases all gamestage to increase challenge but also increased looting.\r\n\r\n=> Workstation Overhaul: Workstations have been overhauled and each now has two levels of complexity. The first level of each can be crafted as soon as you get access to a Claw Hammer and then use it to construct the Worktable. The Forge does not exist in Gnamod and instead is replaced by the Smelter. The Smelter does not melt resources into it, but instead just transforms raw metals into forged resources. These forged resources can then be further processed into other resources or items. Each workstation has room for up to 3 tools and a lot of items can be a workstation tool. Such tools, such as a saw, can unlock recipes or enhance it by increasing yields, lowering costs, or increasing speeds.\r\n\r\n=> Blueprints: Instead of frames or building blocks directly, Gnamod has Blueprint blocks that appear as blue translucent blocks. These do not support any weight and are not solid. They can be upgraded with the correct construction tool and by having the right material on hand. Currently Blueprints support around 100 shapes but in the future more shapes will be added to this system. There are 10 different materials to build with: Wood, Flagstone, Scrap, Clay Brick, Iron, Granite Brick, Steel, Concrete, Stainless Steel and Hardcrete. The chosen shape will determine the properties and upgrade cost of a block, where the rule is: the lower the volume the cheaper to build but also weaker it is going to be. Stone blocks need to dry before they reach their full strength, have additional HP but have lower damage and explosion resistance than metal blocks. Metal blocks need to be upgraded two times to get to their full strength, giving the option to build cheaper but at decreased strength.\r\n\r\n=> No Magic Upgrades: Upgrading from existing POI blocks is not possible. Those blocks also cannot be repaired, only torn down for their resources. Player build blocks can be upgraded using Blueprints and a build tool. The block will be converted to a new Blueprint block of the same shape of the next best material and can then be filled in or picked up. This does not provide any support to be careful while upgrading supporting blocks.\r\n\r\n=> Legacy Distant Terrain: Sphereii shared the code for this, and it has been included into Gnamod. This means Distant Terrain is drawn as it was in A17. This means it does not only perform a bit better, but it also allows the use of custom biomes and terrain textures. This opens the door to much more interesting worlds.\r\n\r\n=> Overhauled Biomes: All existing biomes have been redone in the Gnamod style. The burnt biome has been repurposed as a grassland biome and the water biomes has been brought back underneath the water. New biomes have been added since A20 and more will be added in the near future to improve the look and feel of RWG worlds.\r\n\r\n=> Overhauled RWG: The world generator also known as RWG has been overhauled with both XML tweaks as well as Harmony scripts. This allows for much more interesting worlds to be generated with snowcapped mountains, height-based biomes and even maps keeping the chosen name rather than getting randomly named. These generator changes allow custom biomes to be placed\r\n\r\n=> Looting Overhaul: Looting in Gnamod uses a system where Quantity scales with lootstage and Quality only scales mildly with lootstage. Quality on certain containers is even completely agnostic of lootstage, meaning level 1 characters have the same chance to find something good in them as max level ones. A lot more blocks, like open versions of containers, are lootable in Gnamod as well as boxes and other blocks that look like they could be opened. \r\n\r\n=> Economics Overhaul: The economics in Gnamod have been rebuild from the ground up, where prices of items depend a lot more on their recipes and how hard they are to craft. Items parts and mods add their value, based on quality, directly to the items. This means low quality items with high quality parts will be worth the sum of them and not have price based on the item only.\r\n\r\n=> Questing Overhaul: Trader quests will award rewards based on Gnamod lootstage and higher tier quests have more and better options to pick from even without specializing in questing. The starter quest will now send you to a nearby POI before sending you to a trader. As reward you will get a guaranteed gun package with bullets or medical items once you do make it to the trader.\r\n\r\n=> Dyes: Gnamod comes with 4913 new dyes to find and use. These dyes cover the whole spectrum of colors so it will be hard to find two copies of the same color. Dyes once applied cannot be removed from an item, so be careful when choosing your item’s color.\r\n\r\n=> Multi-Use Items: Gnamod now has items with multiple uses, currently available as Rations and First Aid Kits. These work from the toolbar only but can be used until their durability runs out. The higher the quality the more uses they have.\r\n\r\n-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+= UI FEATURES=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-\r\n=> HUD: Displays HP/Stamina/Food/Water on bottom left along with buffs above them. On the right xp and ammo is shown with the hotbar above it. Harvest notifications are displayed on the left of this. Messages are displayed middle left just below where chat is.\r\n\r\n=> Compass: Displayed top center, shows the compass and markers as well as stealth as a bar inside the compass. Also displays altitude, time, day and world temperature below the compass.\r\n\r\n=> Backpack: 110 (10x11) Slots with integrated toolbar slots on the top for easy access.\r\n\r\n=> Recipe and Workstation Window: Room for 22 categories, 8x6 recipes that can be shown in a grid, easy action buttons for crafting and times at the top and 12 crafting slots at the bottom. Unavailable recipes show greyed out. Clear workstation/lock icon visible for recipe entries. Workstations have space for 3 tools, 3 fuel slots (if they use fuel) and 6 output slots. In vanilla the forge also shows 3 input slots along with info on up to 9 melted items.\r\n\r\n=> Recipe Info Window: Shows 4x4 grid of ingredient info, what it is unlocked by and the description.\r\n\r\n=> Item Info Window: Shows up to 8 stats, the item value, the actions it has, description and its icon.\r\n\r\n=> Character Window: Shows the player and equipped slots (armor left, clothes right) and overlays with additional information.\r\n\r\n=> Buff Window: Shows an entry for each buff, up to 16 per page and the information of that buff in a text window.\r\n\r\n=> Map Window: Centered rectangular map taking up most of the screen. Waypoints and shared waypoints are on the left side and the map starts are on the right side. Right click on the map brings up 2 options, Marker in red and Custom in green. Marker places the flagpole on the clicked spot while custom will bring up a choice of icons on the right side of the map. It has room for 13x32 icons and currently loads all available UI icons to choose from.\r\n\r\n=> Quest Window: Takes up enough space to make all the information easily readable. In the center is the quest description, on the right side the objectives and the rewards. On the left side is the list of available quests and a list of quests being shared with buttons to manipulate them.\r\n\r\n=> Journal Window: Shows a journal entry full screen and has tabs for up to 9 of them you can cycle through to read them. Will no longer flash if you have unread entries.\r\n\r\n=> Creative Menu: Room for 22 categories and 22 subcategories and 9x15 items displayed. Items do not show stack info. \r\n\r\n=> Looting and Vehicle Storage Window: Room for containers up to 10x16 slots in size. Transfer and sorting buttons and slot locking to prevent the first x items to be transferred/sorted when using these buttons.\r\n\r\n=> Assemble and Vehicle Window: Room for 10 mods and 1 cosmetic mod, shows stats of the item/vehicle. Vehicle window also shows buttons to repair/refuel.\r\n\r\n=> Electric Windows: Show the info and slots with a bigger font to make it more easily readable. More space for slots and camera preview.\r\n\r\n=> Trader Window: Shows up to 5x6 items in grid and buy information and actions on the top. Has room for up to 22 categories. \r\n\r\n=> Reward Window: Up to 7 different rewards and trader dialog displayed.\r\n\r\n=> Radial Menu: Changed the size of the Radial menu items. More size for the icons and the text is now below and has a bigger font and more space to show. Makes the radial menu easier to operate.\r\n\r\n=> Target Bar: Entity names are displayed when you look at them, so you get some basic insight into what you are fighting. If HP bar is enabled, it will also show an indication of their HP. When godmode is on it will give the exact numbers.\n","serverGroupDescription":"\r\nGnamod has been developed since A14 by Haidr’Gna, hereafter referred to as mod-author. It all began as a set of tweaks for personal use and grew bigger during A15 into a full overhaul. The name is derived from the mod-author’s nickname and has no special meaning and is not an acronym for anything either.\r\n\r\nGnamod grew from just one overhaul into a group of mods that all share the same base of alterations to the game. This mod is now referred to as Gnamod Core and is the foundation for nearly all Gnamod versions since A17. The only exception is UI, which is known as Gnamod UI and forms the foundation for all UI modifications for Gnamod but is also available as a stand-alone release. \r\n\r\nGnamod is aimed at players that have beaten the vanilla game and are looking for a challenge in all aspects of the game. It slows down the pace of the game by making the player work for their progression instead of handing it out for free. Gnamod aims to bring back the survival experience of the zombie apocalypse where players must scavenge to stay alive and get the gear they need. Building and crafting high quality gear is something players must work for to get started.\r\n\r\nGnamod also aims to improve the quality of the game world, trying to create a more realistic looking apocalypse world. The world generation has been improved to allow for more variation and by adding additional decoration pieces to the biomes. This makes the wilderness areas more interesting to survive in and shifts the focus from exclusively living in the city areas.\r\n\r\nGnamod is a complete overhaul of the game. This means every aspect of the game has been altered in one or more ways and the game has been completely rebalanced around this fact. Gnamod is very much a take it as it is experience, aiming to create a unique take on the game. Due to this nature its very incompatible with other mods, especially overhaul mods that try to do the same.\r\n\r\nGnamod is still very much in development and likely remains so until the base game leaves alpha state. This means there will always be underdeveloped features or things no longer working as expected in a new alpha. Every new alpha, Gnamod will have to adapt to the changes done and this sometimes comes at the loss of features util they can be remade or reworked.\r\n\r\nJoin the Gnamod Discord: https://discord.gg/UrQYp7UVP2\r\n","overrideText":"","remoteReleaseNotes":"","author":"","downloadType":"Clone","logoUrl":"","serverLogo":"","recommendVersion":"","useEac":false,"webSite":"","releaseNotes":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NGp14ZzXQmHn2nA3JSqL0ppz7hQMpdSt?usp=sharing","discord":"","donate":"","twitter":"","bannerLink":"","indexAlpha":"Alpha20","deploymentType":"Partial"},{"AutoInstall":false,"downloads":[{"modlet":false,"DownloadUrl":"https://Gnamod@dev.azure.com/Gnamod/Core/_git/Dev","Branch":"","GameVersion":"","RootFolder":"C:\\7D2D2\\Alpha20\\Gnamod\\Gnamod_Core_(Latest)","TargetName":"","UpdateAvailable":false}],"excludedPaths":[".gitattributes",".gitignore"],"strReadMe":"\n===============Current Version 0.9.0.4 Latest (A20.6)===============\r\nGnamod is split into two core mods: Gnamod Core and Gnamod UI. Gnamod Core nearly has all changes related to gameplay, world creation and includes all assets, textures, icons, and patches required for the mod to function. Gnamod UI contains the user interface mod and its required files. This mod can be used with the base game without Gnamod Core. Both are required to be installed to play Gnamod or any of its add-on modes described in the following paragraphs. The mod launcher installations and manual download zip files will also include additional mods that are optional and will be disabled by default. Some of these are small optional alterations while others are game modes that alter how the mod is played.\r\n\r\nJoin the Gnamod Discord: https://discord.gg/UrQYp7UVP2\r\n-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=FEATURES=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-\r\n=> Entity Stat Randomization: Zombies and Animals in Gnamod have their stats randomized, this includes HP, Speed, Damage, Size, Walktype and Appearance. This makes zombies challenging and interesting as you never really known beforehand what you are dealing with.\r\n\r\n=> Zombie Groups and Classes: The following groups exist: World, Sleeper, Horde, Bloodmoon, Radiated and Radsleeper. Groups are super types that dictate the zombie’s final power and where they will be encountered. Then there are zombie classes, which dictate their behavior and their abilities. The following classes exist: Dasher, Mook, Grunt, Average, Strong, Climber, Puker, Feral, Boss, Volatile and Bomber. Dasher is fast but weak. Mook, Grunt, Average, Strong, are all regular but stronger as you go up. Climbers walk on all fours and jump around. Pukers launch corrosive acid projectiles. Ferals are stronger and faster. Bosses are slower but puke multiple corrosive acid projectiles and they are much stronger. Volatile and Bomber both can explode, but Bombers also act like Climbers.\r\n\r\n=> Animal Behavior Templates: There are templates that animals can extend from giving them a certain behavior. Currently there is Timid, Weary, Neutral, Dangerous, Hostile and Undead. Timid animals will never fight, Weary animals have heightened senses and will not fight unless cornered, Neutral animals will mostly move away if you get close but engage when they are threatened, Dangerous animals have lowered senses but will always engage when something gets in their sights, Hostile animals have heightened senses and actively engage. Undead animals are considered zombies and will only attack the player and non-zombie animals, they will never give up pursuit unless they lose sight.\r\n\r\n=> Overhauled Spawning: Gamestaging, Biome Spawns, Wandering Hordes, Sleepers and Bloodmoons have all been redone for Gnamod. On average there are a lot more zombies in the world and more at night. In cities the number of zombies is higher, especially in the more urban areas. Biomes affect what can spawn, with forest being the easiest and wasteland the hardest. Living animals only spawn in the wilderness, in cities you can encounter zombie animals instead. Wandering Hordes and Bloodmoon Hordes are gamestaged and have waves of zombies mixed with animals. There are no specific ‘Screamer’ zombies in Gnamod, heat made by player activity will attract normal zombies and this will intensify as the gamestage rises.\r\n\r\n=> Resource Overhaul: Gnamod completely overhauls the resource system and adds a load of new resource items in various categories. Gnamod distinguishes the following resource categories: Mineral, Harvest, Junk, Resource, Material and Component. Mineral includes mined or dug up resources such as ores, soils, and stones. Harvest includes harvested resources from natural sources such as plants, trees and, animals. Junk includes anything that pretty much has limited value to crafting and mostly can just be scrapped or sold. Resource includes manufactured items that can be looted, crafted, or obtained from disassembly. Material includes building materials, usually made from various raw resources. Component includes specific resources used in the crafting of ammunition items. Gnamod currently has over 190+ resource items.\r\n\r\n=> Weapon/Firearm Parts: All firearms, tools, melee, and ranged weapons have been redone for Gnamod and now come with parts you need to collect to make them work.

Stun baton is now a unique club while the torch and flashlight are both usable as clubs. \r\n\r\n=> Schematic Perks: Reworked Schematics and added Perks to keep track of unlocked technology.

This makes zombies challenging and interesting as you never really known beforehand what you are dealing with.\r\n\r\n=> Zombie Groups and Classes: The following groups exist: World, Sleeper, Horde, Bloodmoon, Radiated and Radsleeper. Groups are super types that dictate the zombie’s final power and where they will be encountered. Then there are zombie classes, which dictate their behavior and their abilities. The following classes exist: Dasher, Mook, Grunt, Average, Strong, Climber, Puker, Feral, Boss, Volatile and Bomber. Dasher is fast but weak. Mook, Grunt, Average, Strong, are all regular but stronger as you go up. Climbers walk on all fours and jump around. Pukers launch corrosive acid projectiles. Ferals are stronger and faster. Bosses are slower but puke multiple corrosive acid projectiles and they are much stronger. Volatile and Bomber both can explode, but Bombers also act like Climbers.\r\n\r\n=> Animal Behavior Templates: There are templates that animals can extend from giving them a certain behavior. Currently there is Timid, Weary, Neutral, Dangerous, Hostile and Undead. Timid animals will never fight, Weary animals have heightened senses and will not fight unless cornered, Neutral animals will mostly move away if you get close but engage when they are threatened, Dangerous animals have lowered senses but will always engage when something gets in their sights, Hostile animals have heightened senses and actively engage. Undead animals are considered zombies and will only attack the player and non-zombie animals, they will never give up pursuit unless they lose sight.\r\n\r\n=> Overhauled Spawning: Gamestaging, Biome Spawns, Wandering Hordes, Sleepers and Bloodmoons have all been redone for Gnamod. On average there are a lot more zombies in the world and more at night. In cities the number of zombies is higher, especially in the more urban areas. Biomes affect what can spawn, with forest being the easiest and wasteland the hardest. Living animals only spawn in the wilderness, in cities you can encounter zombie animals instead. Wandering Hordes and Bloodmoon Hordes are gamestaged and have waves of zombies mixed with animals. There are no specific ‘Screamer’ zombies in Gnamod, heat made by player activity will attract normal zombies and this will intensify as the gamestage rises.\r\n\r\n=> Resource Overhaul: Gnamod completely overhauls the resource system and adds a load of new resource items in various categories. Gnamod distinguishes the following resource categories: Mineral, Harvest, Junk, Resource, Material and Component. Mineral includes mined or dug up resources such as ores, soils, and stones. Harvest includes harvested resources from natural sources such as plants, trees and, animals. Junk includes anything that pretty much has limited value to crafting and mostly can just be scrapped or sold. Resource includes manufactured items that can be looted, crafted, or obtained from disassembly. Material includes building materials, usually made from various raw resources. Component includes specific resources used in the crafting of ammunition items. Gnamod currently has over 190+ resource items.\r\n\r\n=> Weapon/Firearm Parts: All firearms, tools, melee, and ranged weapons have been redone for Gnamod and now come with parts you need to collect to make them work. Firearms and motorized tools consist of 5 parts that include the weapon itself while tools, melee, and ranged weapons generally consist of 3 or less parts. These weapon parts function like the A16 system where you assembled a weapon from parts and have quality as well. Broken and makeshift parts also exist that either need to be replaced or make the weapon function poorly. While looting or trading you can find these with parts attached or find the parts separately.\r\n\r\n=> Ammunition Overhaul: Firearm ammunition has been reworked to add more different calibers. The following ammo now exists: .22 LR, .38 SP, .45 ACP, 9mm, 5.56mm, 7.62mm, .44 Mag, .500 Mag, 30.06, .50BMG, 20 GA, 12 GA and 10 GA. Each of these calibers also has a HP and AP version (these are slugs for Shotguns), and each has 3 quality levels: Reloaded, Normal and Pristine. For this, new components were added as well, split into small, medium, large, and shell.\r\n\r\n=> Firearms: Firearms have been redone, with 4 distinct versions of each type (Pistol, Rifle, Assault, and Shotgun). Each has 3 different calibers to choose from as well. \r\n\r\n=> Bows/Crossbows: Bows and Crossbows have been redone as well as arrows and bolts that now come in more different materials: Wood, Stone, Bone, Scrap, Iron, Steel and Titanium. \r\n\r\n=> Melee/Tools: Melee weapons and tools have been redone, Axes, Picks and Shovels are now decent weapons alongside their tool use and melee weapons have been grouped into Clubs, Blades, Spears, Sledges, and Fists. Stun baton is now a unique club while the torch and flashlight are both usable as clubs. \r\n\r\n=> Schematic Perks: Reworked Schematics and added Perks to keep track of unlocked technology. Normal perks will no longer unlock anything but the most basic level of a related technology. This means finding or buying technology is more important. Some of these perks allow spending precious perk points to increase their level.\r\n\r\n=> Progression Overhaul: The experience curve has been adjusted and there is a soft level cap of 100 where no skill points can be earned from gaining new levels. The maximum amount of skill points from levels is 134 and currently 5 additional points are earned from the starter story. Eventually the maximum points will be 150 once the progression overhaul has been completed.\r\n\r\n=> New Perks: Lucky Looter no longer offers a flat bonus to lootstage, it can only increase as much as the player’s current level. Added a new perk: Bring it On, which increases all gamestage to increase challenge but also increased looting.\r\n\r\n=> Workstation Overhaul: Workstations have been overhauled and each now has two levels of complexity. The first level of each can be crafted as soon as you get access to a Claw Hammer and then use it to construct the Worktable. The Forge does not exist in Gnamod and instead is replaced by the Smelter. The Smelter does not melt resources into it, but instead just transforms raw metals into forged resources. These forged resources can then be further processed into other resources or items. Each workstation has room for up to 3 tools and a lot of items can be a workstation tool. Such tools, such as a saw, can unlock recipes or enhance it by increasing yields, lowering costs, or increasing speeds.\r\n\r\n=> Blueprints: Instead of frames or building blocks directly, Gnamod has Blueprint blocks that appear as blue translucent blocks. These do not support any weight and are not solid. They can be upgraded with the correct construction tool and by having the right material on hand. Currently Blueprints support around 100 shapes but in the future more shapes will be added to this system. There are 10 different materials to build with: Wood, Flagstone, Scrap, Clay Brick, Iron, Granite Brick, Steel, Concrete, Stainless Steel and Hardcrete. The chosen shape will determine the properties and upgrade cost of a block, where the rule is: the lower the volume the cheaper to build but also weaker it is going to be. Stone blocks need to dry before they reach their full strength, have additional HP but have lower damage and explosion resistance than metal blocks. Metal blocks need to be upgraded two times to get to their full strength, giving the option to build cheaper but at decreased strength.\r\n\r\n=> No Magic Upgrades: Upgrading from existing POI blocks is not possible. Those blocks also cannot be repaired, only torn down for their resources. Player build blocks can be upgraded using Blueprints and a build tool. The block will be converted to a new Blueprint block of the same shape of the next best material and can then be filled in or picked up. This does not provide any support to be careful while upgrading supporting blocks.\r\n\r\n=> Legacy Distant Terrain: Sphereii shared the code for this, and it has been included into Gnamod. This means Distant Terrain is drawn as it was in A17. This means it does not only perform a bit better, but it also allows the use of custom biomes and terrain textures. This opens the door to much more interesting worlds.\r\n\r\n=> Overhauled Biomes: All existing biomes have been redone in the Gnamod style. The burnt biome has been repurposed as a grassland biome and the water biomes has been brought back underneath the water. New biomes have been added since A20 and more will be added in the near future to improve the look and feel of RWG worlds.\r\n\r\n=> Overhauled RWG: The world generator also known as RWG has been overhauled with both XML tweaks as well as Harmony scripts. This allows for much more interesting worlds to be generated with snowcapped mountains, height-based biomes and even maps keeping the chosen name rather than getting randomly named. These generator changes allow custom biomes to be placed\r\n\r\n=> Looting Overhaul: Looting in Gnamod uses a system where Quantity scales with lootstage and Quality only scales mildly with lootstage. Quality on certain containers is even completely agnostic of lootstage, meaning level 1 characters have the same chance to find something good in them as max level ones. A lot more blocks, like open versions of containers, are lootable in Gnamod as well as boxes and other blocks that look like they could be opened. \r\n\r\n=> Economics Overhaul: The economics in Gnamod have been rebuild from the ground up, where prices of items depend a lot more on their recipes and how hard they are to craft. Items parts and mods add their value, based on quality, directly to the items. This means low quality items with high quality parts will be worth the sum of them and not have price based on the item only.\r\n\r\n=> Questing Overhaul: Trader quests will award rewards based on Gnamod lootstage and higher tier quests have more and better options to pick from even without specializing in questing. The starter quest will now send you to a nearby POI before sending you to a trader. As reward you will get a guaranteed gun package with bullets or medical items once you do make it to the trader.\r\n\r\n=> Dyes: Gnamod comes with 4913 new dyes to find and use. These dyes cover the whole spectrum of colors so it will be hard to find two copies of the same color. Dyes once applied cannot be removed from an item, so be careful when choosing your item’s color.\r\n\r\n=> Multi-Use Items: Gnamod now has items with multiple uses, currently available as Rations and First Aid Kits. These work from the toolbar only but can be used until their durability runs out. The higher the quality the more uses they have.\r\n\r\n-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+= UI FEATURES=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-\r\n=> HUD: Displays HP/Stamina/Food/Water on bottom left along with buffs above them. On the right xp and ammo is shown with the hotbar above it. Harvest notifications are displayed on the left of this. Messages are displayed middle left just below where chat is.\r\n\r\n=> Compass: Displayed top center, shows the compass and markers as well as stealth as a bar inside the compass. Also displays altitude, time, day and world temperature below the compass.\r\n\r\n=> Backpack: 110 (10x11) Slots with integrated toolbar slots on the top for easy access.\r\n\r\n=> Recipe and Workstation Window: Room for 22 categories, 8x6 recipes that can be shown in a grid, easy action buttons for crafting and times at the top and 12 crafting slots at the bottom. Unavailable recipes show greyed out. Clear workstation/lock icon visible for recipe entries. Workstations have space for 3 tools, 3 fuel slots (if they use fuel) and 6 output slots. In vanilla the forge also shows 3 input slots along with info on up to 9 melted items.\r\n\r\n=> Recipe Info Window: Shows 4x4 grid of ingredient info, what it is unlocked by and the description.\r\n\r\n=> Item Info Window: Shows up to 8 stats, the item value, the actions it has, description and its icon.\r\n\r\n=> Character Window: Shows the player and equipped slots (armor left, clothes right) and overlays with additional information.\r\n\r\n=> Buff Window: Shows an entry for each buff, up to 16 per page and the information of that buff in a text window.\r\n\r\n=> Map Window: Centered rectangular map taking up most of the screen. Waypoints and shared waypoints are on the left side and the map starts are on the right side. Right click on the map brings up 2 options, Marker in red and Custom in green. Marker places the flagpole on the clicked spot while custom will bring up a choice of icons on the right side of the map. It has room for 13x32 icons and currently loads all available UI icons to choose from.\r\n\r\n=> Quest Window: Takes up enough space to make all the information easily readable. In the center is the quest description, on the right side the objectives and the rewards. On the left side is the list of available quests and a list of quests being shared with buttons to manipulate them.\r\n\r\n=> Journal Window: Shows a journal entry full screen and has tabs for up to 9 of them you can cycle through to read them. Will no longer flash if you have unread entries.\r\n\r\n=> Creative Menu: Room for 22 categories and 22 subcategories and 9x15 items displayed. Items do not show stack info. \r\n\r\n=> Looting and Vehicle Storage Window: Room for containers up to 10x16 slots in size. Transfer and sorting buttons and slot locking to prevent the first x items to be transferred/sorted when using these buttons.\r\n\r\n=> Assemble and Vehicle Window: Room for 10 mods and 1 cosmetic mod, shows stats of the item/vehicle. Vehicle window also shows buttons to repair/refuel.\r\n\r\n=> Electric Windows: Show the info and slots with a bigger font to make it more easily readable. More space for slots and camera preview.\r\n\r\n=> Trader Window: Shows up to 5x6 items in grid and buy information and actions on the top. Has room for up to 22 categories. \r\n\r\n=> Reward Window: Up to 7 different rewards and trader dialog displayed.\r\n\r\n=> Radial Menu: Changed the size of the Radial menu items. More size for the icons and the text is now below and has a bigger font and more space to show. Makes the radial menu easier to operate.\r\n\r\n=> Target Bar: Entity names are displayed when you look at them, so you get some basic insight into what you are fighting. If HP bar is enabled, it will also show an indication of their HP. When godmode is on it will give the exact numbers.\n","serverGroupDescription":"\r\nGnamod has been developed since A14 by Haidr’Gna, hereafter referred to as mod-author. It all began as a set of tweaks for personal use and grew bigger during A15 into a full overhaul. The name is derived from the mod-author’s nickname and has no special meaning and is not an acronym for anything either.\r\n\r\nGnamod grew from just one overhaul into a group of mods that all share the same base of alterations to the game. This mod is now referred to as Gnamod Core and is the foundation for nearly all Gnamod versions since A17. The only exception is UI, which is known as Gnamod UI and forms the foundation for all UI modifications for Gnamod but is also available as a stand-alone release. \r\n\r\nGnamod is aimed at players that have beaten the vanilla game and are looking for a challenge in all aspects of the game. It slows down the pace of the game by making the player work for their progression instead of handing it out for free. Gnamod aims to bring back the survival experience of the zombie apocalypse where players must scavenge to stay alive and get the gear they need. Building and crafting high quality gear is something players must work for to get started.\r\n\r\nGnamod also aims to improve the quality of the game world, trying to create a more realistic looking apocalypse world. The world generation has been improved to allow for more variation and by adding additional decoration pieces to the biomes. This makes the wilderness areas more interesting to survive in and shifts the focus from exclusively living in the city areas.\r\n\r\nGnamod is a complete overhaul of the game. This means every aspect of the game has been altered in one or more ways and the game has been completely rebalanced around this fact. Gnamod is very much a take it as it is experience, aiming to create a unique take on the game. Due to this nature its very incompatible with other mods, especially overhaul mods that try to do the same.\r\n\r\nGnamod is still very much in development and likely remains so until the base game leaves alpha state. This means there will always be underdeveloped features or things no longer working as expected in a new alpha. Every new alpha, Gnamod will have to adapt to the changes done and this sometimes comes at the loss of features util they can be remade or reworked.\r\n\r\nJoin the Gnamod Discord: https://discord.gg/UrQYp7UVP2\r\n","overrideText":"","remoteReleaseNotes":"","author":"","downloadType":"Clone","logoUrl":"","serverLogo":"","recommendVersion":"","useEac":false,"webSite":"","releaseNotes":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NGp14ZzXQmHn2nA3JSqL0ppz7hQMpdSt?usp=sharing","discord":"","donate":"","twitter":"","bannerLink":"","indexAlpha":"Alpha20","deploymentType":"Partial"},{"AutoInstall":false,"downloads":[{"modlet":false,"DownloadUrl":"https://Gnamod@dev.azure.com/Gnamod/Core/_git/Exp","Branch":"","GameVersion":"","RootFolder":"C:\\7D2D2\\Alpha20\\Gnamod\\Gnamod_Core_(Experimental)","TargetName":"","UpdateAvailable":false}],"excludedPaths":[".gitattributes",".gitignore"],"strReadMe":"\n===============Current Version 0.10.0.0 Experimental (A20.6)===============\r\n+++++WARNING!!+++++\r\nThis is the experimental version of Gnamod.\r\nOnly download this version if you want to contribute to Gnamod's development or preview upcoming features.\r\nThis build is not suitable for long play and may even result in bugs/crashes and loss of save data.\r\nDo not load saves or worlds of previous Gnamod versions.\r\n+++++WARNING!!+++++\r\n\r\nJoin the Gnamod Discord: https://discord.gg/UrQYp7UVP2\n","IsVanilla":false,"ModSetting":{"downloadSize":1,"currentVersion":"","useEAC":false,"keepUptodate":true,"numberOfBackups":5,"lastShortID":"","lastGamePath":""},"modName":"Gnamod Core (Experimental)","installedGameVersion":"","modGroup":"Gnamod","description":"\n===============Current Version 0.10.0.0 Experimental (A20.6)===============\r\n+++++WARNING!!+++++\r\nThis is the experimental version of Gnamod.\r\nOnly download this version if you want to contribute to Gnamod's development or preview upcoming features.\r\nThis build is not suitable for long play and may even result in bugs/crashes and loss of save data.\r\nDo not load saves or worlds of previous Gnamod versions.\r\n+++++WARNING!!+++++\r\n\r\nJoin the Gnamod Discord: <link=https://discord.gg/UrQYp7UVP2>https://discord.gg/UrQYp7UVP2</link>\n","serverGroupDescription":"\r\nGnamod has been developed since A14 by Haidr’Gna, hereafter referred to as mod-author.

It has been an idea for years and is finally a realization. It literally started as a joke and grew from there. The mod has been made so that players can have a serious playthrough and not just log in for 5 minutes, have some laughs, and never play it again. Although some people might still do that. Rude!\n\nThis mod was thought up/created by RizzoMF and Zilox with consultation from Khaine and killerbunny264.

Well now you can!\nSTORY: Experience the 1998 Spencer Mansion Incident as Jill Valentine. Collect keys, solve puzzles, manage your limited resources and escape from the Survival Horror.\n\n******KNOWN BUGS******\n1) Clicking 'Equip' on an item in your main inventory - You will get an infinite wall of red text, to stop it, move an item from your toolbelt or into your toolbelt.\nDO NOT ALT+F4 AS YOUR CHARACTER WILL RESET!\n2) (The Linked Vault Storage is disabled by default due to bugs) In Multiplayer, when accessing an Untouched Vault,\n*ALL* players need to open the Untouched Vault *BEFORE* anyone adds or removes items. Otherwise, ITEMS WILL DISAPPEAR!!!\n3) (The Linked Vault Storage is disabled by default due to bugs) Unconfirmed on what the cause is, it may be due to trying to load into the game while you're not logged into steam, or playing a different save, vanilla or another mod.\nThe entire contents of 'The Vault' can get deleted. My advice is to commit to a playthrough before playing other 7 Days to Die playthroughs elsewhere.\n\nSetup:\n1) I've made setup easy to follow by making the text orange for all settings you'll need to manually change for the intended Resident Evil experience.\n2) It will always be night, so be sure to change the Zombie Night Speed to your liking. (Walk is recommended)\n3) If your game is in day time, you'll die a horrible death!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: \n1) The Spencer Mansion Incident is a *PERMADEATH* mod, and will test your combat and maneuverability skills.\n2) Multiplayer is now supported!!! So go have fun with a friend!\n3) Twitch Integration is now supported!! I recommend to use only after completing the challenge before turning on.\nKEY FEATURES:\n1) Limited Inventory: You'll be restricted to a 6 slot toolbelt and 6 slots of main inventory.\n2) Reworked and rebalanced Skill Tree: There are no attribute requirements for skills, so you'll be free to put your skill points wherever you wish as long as you have enough points.\n3) You cannot jump.\n4) Zombie Pain: Zombies no longer feel pain, so they won't even flinch when attacked.\n5) Zombie Rage: Disabled, zombies will never enter rage mode and get faster.\n6) One Time Looting: Almost every loot container can only be looted once, and will downgrade or destroy after closing.\n7) Linked Storage (disabled by default due to bugs): You'll be able to access your stored items from any of the storage boxes. (Huge thank you to wOOkie nOOkie!!)\n8) Simplified Criticals: I've removed the severe critical injuries (Broken arm/leg etc) and shortened the duration of fatigue. You can still get lessor criticals, like sprains, fatigue, stun and abrasions. (Falling too far will still break your leg!)\nPLANNED FEATURE:\nManual Saving: Auto saving will be disabled and you'll need to use an Ink Ribbon to save your progress.\nYou'll have to manually save BEFORE you exit your game session.\nInk Ribbons will be very limited, and will allow you to continue your save if you die, by simply exiting the game and reloading your save to revert back to your last manual save.\n\n7 Days to Die Forum Thread - https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/27467-the-spencer-mansion-incident-resident-evil-a201/\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/4A5MF8GHM5\nInfo Spreadsheet (spoilers) - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tqa0JeUROVYSJv0rxZ2YRkOFY4njxbUISr7dm96D83s/edit#gid=0\nList of Character Perks - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iuVP-4PKLAQmtRivr3wS2mXJ8hcvMuXvgR7V2tbfIlA/edit#gid=0\n\nUPDATES:\nv2.0 changes (Requires Fresh Start)\n\nChanged: You now start with 12 perk points, instead of 2, in the form of Training Manuals.\n\t Choose your points wisely, as there are no refunds and no extras for the entire playthrough.\nChanged: Perks are rebalanced, and each level now costs 1 Training Manual. Before, some perks cost 2 points.\nChanged: All attributes are only 1 level, granting 250% headshot damage and 15% bonus to dismember.\nChanged: You now start with 120 Health and Stamina instead of 100.\nChanged: Power Attacks no longer pause stamina regeneration.\nRemoved: Demolitions Expert perk.\nAdded: Armour Tolerance perk. This perk does what Pain Tolerance used to do, but now also reduces the stamina and mobility penalties of armour.\nChanged: Pain Tolerance now works like in vanilla, but slightly more potent. (TFP fixed a bug recently so this perk works as intended now)\nRemoved: Gloves, there are now 4 pieces of armour instead of 5.\nChanged: Rebalanced the armour rating of all armour to compensate the loss of the gloves piece.\nChanged: Rebalanced ammo crafting with the Reloading Tool, the amount of gunpowder to craft each round is equivilant to the firepower of that round.\nChanged: Reloading Tool now stacks to 10 instead of 1, so ammo crafting is less tedious than before.\nAdded: Reloading Tool can now also allow you to dismantle standard ammo, at a cost of 25% gunpowder. (Requires Reloading Tool on you to dismantle)\nChanged: Moved one of the Locked Reinforced chests to an earlier section of the mod for earlier access.\nChanged: Removed campfire recipe and added campfires in most locations with a Storage Box. Includes the kitchen.\nAdded: Placed a Blue Herb in each of the mansion's Save Rooms.\nChanged: Poison is now more deadly, lowering health every 30 seconds instead of 50.\nRemoved: You no longer get XP from harvesting anything, or reading books.

Resident Evil","description":"\nHave you ever wanted to play Resident Evil in first person? Well now you can!\nSTORY: Experience the 1998 Spencer Mansion Incident as Jill Valentine. Collect keys, solve puzzles, manage your limited resources and escape from the Survival Horror.\n\n******KNOWN BUGS******\n1) Clicking 'Equip' on an item in your main inventory - You will get an infinite wall of red text, to stop it, move an item from your toolbelt or into your toolbelt.\nDO NOT ALT+F4 AS YOUR CHARACTER WILL RESET!\n2) (The Linked Vault Storage is disabled by default due to bugs) In Multiplayer, when accessing an Untouched Vault,\n*ALL* players need to open the Untouched Vault *BEFORE* anyone adds or removes items. Otherwise, ITEMS WILL DISAPPEAR!!!\n3) (The Linked Vault Storage is disabled by default due to bugs) Unconfirmed on what the cause is, it may be due to trying to load into the game while you're not logged into steam, or playing a different save, vanilla or another mod.\nThe entire contents of 'The Vault' can get deleted. My advice is to commit to a playthrough before playing other 7 Days to Die playthroughs elsewhere.\n\nSetup:\n1) I've made setup easy to follow by making the text orange for all settings you'll need to manually change for the intended Resident Evil experience.\n2) It will always be night, so be sure to change the Zombie Night Speed to your liking. (Walk is recommended)\n3) If your game is in day time, you'll die a horrible death!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: \n1) The Spencer Mansion Incident is a *PERMADEATH* mod, and will test your combat and maneuverability skills.\n2) Multiplayer is now supported!!! So go have fun with a friend!\n3) Twitch Integration is now supported!! I recommend to use only after completing the challenge before turning on.\nKEY FEATURES:\n1) Limited Inventory: You'll be restricted to a 6 slot toolbelt and 6 slots of main inventory.\n2) Reworked and rebalanced Skill Tree: There are no attribute requirements for skills, so you'll be free to put your skill points wherever you wish as long as you have enough points.\n3) You cannot jump.\n4) Zombie Pain: Zombies no longer feel pain, so they won't even flinch when attacked.\n5) Zombie Rage: Disabled, zombies will never enter rage mode and get faster.\n6) One Time Looting: Almost every loot container can only be looted once, and will downgrade or destroy after closing.\n7) Linked Storage (disabled by default due to bugs): You'll be able to access your stored items from any of the storage boxes. (Huge thank you to wOOkie nOOkie!!)\n8) Simplified Criticals: I've removed the severe critical injuries (Broken arm/leg etc) and shortened the duration of fatigue. You can still get lessor criticals, like sprains, fatigue, stun and abrasions. (Falling too far will still break your leg!)\nPLANNED FEATURE:\nManual Saving: Auto saving will be disabled and you'll need to use an Ink Ribbon to save your progress.\nYou'll have to manually save BEFORE you exit your game session.\nInk Ribbons will be very limited, and will allow you to continue your save if you die, by simply exiting the game and reloading your save to revert back to your last manual save.\n\n7 Days to Die Forum Thread - <link=https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/27467-the-spencer-mansion-incident-resident-evil-a201>https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/27467-the-spencer-mansion-incident-resident-evil-a201</link>/\nDiscord - <link=https://discord.gg/4A5MF8GHM5>https://discord.gg/4A5MF8GHM5</link>\nInfo Spreadsheet (spoilers) - <link=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tqa0JeUROVYSJv0rxZ2YRkOFY4njxbUISr7dm96D83s/edit#gid=0>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tqa0JeUROVYSJv0rxZ2YRkOFY4njxbUISr7dm96D83s/edit#gid=0</link>\nList of Character Perks - <link=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iuVP-4PKLAQmtRivr3wS2mXJ8hcvMuXvgR7V2tbfIlA/edit#gid=0>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iuVP-4PKLAQmtRivr3wS2mXJ8hcvMuXvgR7V2tbfIlA/edit#gid=0</link>\n\nUPDATES:\nv2.0 changes (Requires Fresh Start)\n\nChanged: You now start with 12 perk points, instead of 2, in the form of Training Manuals.\n\t Choose your points wisely, as there are no refunds and no extras for the entire playthrough.\nChanged: Perks are rebalanced, and each level now costs 1 Training Manual. Before, some perks cost 2 points.\nChanged: All attributes are only 1 level, granting 250% headshot damage and 15% bonus to dismember.\nChanged: You now start with 120 Health and Stamina instead of 100.\nChanged: Power Attacks no longer pause stamina regeneration.\nRemoved: Demolitions Expert perk.\nAdded: Armour Tolerance perk. This perk does what Pain Tolerance used to do, but now also reduces the stamina and mobility penalties of armour.\nChanged: Pain Tolerance now works like in vanilla, but slightly more potent. (TFP fixed a bug recently so this perk works as intended now)\nRemoved: Gloves, there are now 4 pieces of armour instead of 5.\nChanged: Rebalanced the armour rating of all armour to compensate the loss of the gloves piece.\nChanged: Rebalanced ammo crafting with the Reloading Tool, the amount of gunpowder to craft each round is equivilant to the firepower of that round.\nChanged: Reloading Tool now stacks to 10 instead of 1, so ammo crafting is less tedious than before.\nAdded: Reloading Tool can now also allow you to dismantle standard ammo, at a cost of 25% gunpowder. (Requires Reloading Tool on you to dismantle)\nChanged: Moved one of the Locked Reinforced chests to an earlier section of the mod for earlier access.\nChanged: Removed campfire recipe and added campfires in most locations with a Storage Box. Includes the kitchen.\nAdded: Placed a Blue Herb in each of the mansion's Save Rooms.\nChanged: Poison is now more deadly, lowering health every 30 seconds instead of 50.\nRemoved: You no longer get XP from harvesting anything, or reading books. XP is mostly earned from kills.\nChanged: Player Level and Gamestage is solely used for Twitch Integration and mod progression, no perk points.\nChanged: Herbs heal more, up to 60 with a mixture of G+R+B. This mixture used to heal 40.\nChanged: Medical healing recovers health at 5 per tick instead of 2.\nChanged: Nerfed the firepower of the AK-47 from 42 Standard and 56 HiPower, to 24 Standard and 30 HiPower.\nAdded: Another 60 rounds of Assault Rifle ammo, bringing the total non-crafted amount from 90 to 150.\nChanged: Extra 2 Player support, some looted items now come in doubles.\nFixed: Rockets now cause radius damage instead of just impact damage.

(Survival Instinct)\n\t\t\t- Dying has a harsher consequence, retaining debuffs and hunger, etc.\n\t\t\t- An optional 'Master Mode' that turns all lesser normal zombies into ferals, and  lesser ferals into radiateds!\n\t\t\n\t\t\t**Strongly recommend that you generate a random map**\n\n\t\t\tFull list of changes can be found in the Mods folder.\n","serverGroupDescription":"","overrideText":"","remoteReleaseNotes":"","author":"","downloadType":"Clone","logoUrl":"","serverLogo":"","recommendVersion":"A20.7","useEac":false,"webSite":"","releaseNotes":"","discord":"","donate":"","twitter":"","bannerLink":"","indexAlpha":"Alpha20","deploymentType":"Partial"},{"AutoInstall":false,"downloads":[{"modlet":false,"DownloadUrl":"https://github.com/arramus/Preppocalypse","Branch":"","GameVersion":"","RootFolder":"C:\\7D2D2\\Alpha20\\Preppocalypse_(A20)\\Preppocalypse_(A20)","TargetName":"","UpdateAvailable":false}],"excludedPaths":[],"strReadMe":"\n7D2D from the perspective of a Prepper.\n\t  \nFeatures Include:\n- Upgraded default zombies in the biomes, hordes, and Game Stage linked POIs\n- A greater abundance of Prepper style quest POIs (custom and TFP conversions) for A21\n- Additional recipes that accommodate Prepper/Survivalist/Bushcrafter traits\n- Upgraded and custom items, weapons, vehicles, and mods to facilitate survival against stronger hostiles\n- Oakraven Collection quality of life additions\n- Custom questing opportunities\nas well as other game play features that are in context with a Prepper’s experience of the afterwards.\n  \nBrought to you by arramus, with an abundance of community support.\n","IsVanilla":false,"ModSetting":{"downloadSize":1,"currentVersion":"","useEAC":false,"keepUptodate":true,"numberOfBackups":5,"lastShortID":"","lastGamePath":""},"modName":"Preppocalypse (A20)","installedGameVersion":"","modGroup":"Preppocalypse (A20)","description":"\n7D2D from the perspective of a Prepper.\n\t  \nFeatures Include:\n- Upgraded default zombies in the biomes, hordes, and Game Stage linked POIs\n- A greater abundance of Prepper style quest POIs (custom and TFP conversions) for A21\n- Additional recipes that accommodate Prepper/Survivalist/Bushcrafter traits\n- Upgraded and custom items, weapons, vehicles, and mods to facilitate survival against stronger hostiles\n- Oakraven Collection quality of life additions\n- Custom questing opportunities\nas well as other game play features that are in context with a Prepper’s experience of the afterwards.\n  \nBrought to you by arramus, with an abundance of community support.\n","serverGroupDescription":"","overrideText":"","remoteReleaseNotes":"","author":"","downloadType":"Clone","logoUrl":"","serverLogo":"","recommendVersion":"alpha20.7","useEac":false,"webSite":"","releaseNotes":"","discord":"https://discord.gg/3aWeEGrjJK","donate":"","twitter":"","bannerLink":"","indexAlpha":"Alpha20","deploymentType":"Partial"}],"alpha":"Alpha20"}
