Itâ€™s time! The Better Vanilla is now also available for the Alpha 20!
Those who already know the Better Vanilla from the A19 know what to expect.
Here is a small selection of the changes:
- Better Vanilla Interface
- 160 Slot Inventory
- 30k Itemstack
- more options for setting up
- Customized zombies
- a zombie-navigator
- Customized weapons and tools
- Autominer / charcoal furnace
- completely revised hunger, thirst, food system
- No screaming and aggressive animals in the wild
. . and many little things that make 7 days different. Nevertheless, the vanilla part is present.

The Better Vanilla is supported in German and English.
Have fun!
