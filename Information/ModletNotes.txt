To Have Modlets Added To The 7D2D Mod Launcher
----------------------------------------------

For indexing, Modlets must be stored on github.com or gitlab.com. No other site is supported.

### How The Mod Launcher Works

The Mod Launcher maintains a master profile ( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SphereII/7D2DConfig/master/Information/ModletProfiles.txt ).

This master profile is used to display modlets for the correct version of the game.

Example:
	Default,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/7D2DMods/Profiles/master/Alpha21/DefaultProfile.txt
	Alpha21,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/7D2DMods/Profiles/master/Alpha21/DefaultProfile.txt
	Alpha20,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/7D2DMods/Profiles/master/Alpha20/DefaultProfile.txt

Default is which folder will be displayed if no particular version is selected.

A Profile for an Alpha will look similar to this:

	# No tailing slashes
	https://github.com/SphereII/SphereII.Mods
	https://github.com/RevenantWit/7D2D_A21_Modlets

	# A refenrece to a text file, which itself contains a list of repos. 
	# This allows the mod author to have a single point of maintenance when their modlets are spread across
	# multiple repos, and avoid having to reach out to the mod launcher maintainer to update.
	# The File name does not matter, but it is a text file.

Indexing occurs when Mod Launcher users do a Fetch. The Mod Launcher will read one of the above profiles, and does API calls to find ModInfo.xml's.

In order to reduce rate limits, the mod launcher sorts and collects all the github repos, and tries to do it in as few queries as possible.

For gitlab, we specify the project id as a parameter, and then makes the query.

The Mod Launcher does not support branches for modlets.

### For Modders

A Modlet Repository can be set up in a few different ways:

1) Multiple Modlets in a single repo, each in their own directory.
2) One modlet per repo, either in its own directory, or in the root of the repos.

Recommended: Multiple Modlets in a single repo, each in their own directory.

If you have one modlet per repo, and you have many repos, consider creating a text file with a link to all the repos:

Example: profile.txt
	https://github.com/DonovanMods/donovan-7d2d-modlets/tree/stable/donovan-aio
	https://github.com/DonovanMods/donovan-7d2d-modlets/tree/stable/donovan-betterblades
	https://github.com/DonovanMods/donovan-7d2d-modlets/tree/stable/donovan-betterbridges
	https://github.com/DonovanMods/donovan-7d2d-modlets/tree/stable/donovan-betterbuffs

Once you have your repo created, and ready, send the link to sphereii. Either on discord, or through email at Support@7D2DModLauncher.org.

If you use Multiple Modlets in a single repo, you may add and remove modlets as necessary without contacting sphereii. It is updated automatically.

If you use one modlet per repo, and use a profile.txt, then update your file. It is not necessary to contact sphereii.

If you use one modlet per repo, and you do not use a profile.txt, you will need to contact sphereii for each new repo to be added.
