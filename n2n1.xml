         <Description>Classic Style Hardcore
This mod uses the style of the old Alphas, while it is a completely new project based on the atmosphere and playability of the old school. The principles of survival here can be significantly different from what you are used to! (most likely will need to relearn things)

There is a lot of changes. I think, for the first week Survival you will not see even a third of all of the features of mod (not to mention the modified RWG and the new content for it) . I consider, that i have original finds. The game became more lively and moderately realistic. Some are simplified for that would complicate things other.
Now the take direction to more realistic. I introduce its innovations, but i try to be careful with the original material and the atmosphere from Old 7DtD.

Mod is always WIP (since A13.4), i play and make balance, add stuff.

This mod is about Survival. Here is Atmosphere. 
Explore the world which was left by people after yourself. 

(Mod designed for SP only)

The mod is designed for experienced 7DtD players.
