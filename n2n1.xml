         <Description>Classic Style Hardcore
Before out of A13, and the come changes, I have decided to bring closer as much as possible New to an Old habitual look.
After deepening in work it became clear that new changes have also good parties and now the hybrid has turned out.
There is a lot of changes - not all in the list. 
I consider that I have original finds which are implemented very easily. Game to become more live and moderately difficult.
Some are simplified for that would complicate things other.
