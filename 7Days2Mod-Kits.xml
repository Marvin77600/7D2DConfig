         <Description>Valmar's Expansion Mod with Magoli's CompoPack
This is a relatively large mod pack I've gradually created over time. It's mainly a collaboration of all my smaller mods placed together into one larger file.

The Expansion pack is meant to be viewed, as the name implies, as an expansion pack for the game. What this means is that it adds a bunch of new features to the game without dramatically changing the overall vanilla gameplay experience. Great if you're happy with 7DTD but just want to have more stuff to do.</Description>

This is a relatively large mod pack I've gradually created over time. It's mainly a collaboration of all my smaller mods placed together into one larger file.

The Overhaul pack adds the same items and content to the game as the expansion with the key difference being that unlike the expansion the overhaul, as the name implies overhauls some basic aspects of the game. Mainly the recipe system is considerably locked down compared to vanilla. The overhaul is intended for those who want a new experience from the game.</Description>

         <Description>Valmar's Classic Horde Survival Mod with Magoli's CompoPack
 Welcome to CHS - Classic Horde Survival. This mod aims to offer a completely different experience from vanilla. If you want a mod that adds more farming, crafting, building or expands the game to last for hundreds of days this is NOT the mod for you. This mod is intended to be more towards having a few hours of fun in a horde mode rather than spending weeks building cities. If you just want to kill hordes of zombies while scavenging for food and ammo, this mod might be for you.

Warning: If you have a below average computer you may experience FPS issues when playing this mod due to the large number of zombie spawns. You can lower your games spawn settings in the game options to try to dial it back some but your millage may vary.</Description>

         <Description>Lath mod Revised with Magoli's CompoPack
This mod adds suppressed firearms (including the AK47), steel armor, iron bows and crossbows, a modular repeating crossbow, and a few other bits and bobs. Currently the drawbridges and garage doors are disabled, as I'm not satisfied with their functionality and want to see if I can make them work better before putting them back in.

EAC MUST be disabled for this mod to run.

While the majority of the items are things I've added for myself, there are more than a couple items that have either been inspired by other modders, or borrowed in their entirety. The suppressed weapons were originally taken from Rongo's mods, but have been heavily modified to suit my vision. Thanks go out to Valmar for his mods and all his help in troubleshooting mine, Mafke and his drawbridge/hidden door tutorial (and Kadera's modifications of that), Razzoriel's Deathwish for some inspiration, and Sergant1000 for his experimental weapons. Credit goes to Tritox for his HUD mod, stallionsden for the backpack extension, ClockworkOrange for the Unofficial XML fixes, and three08 for the rebreather.
