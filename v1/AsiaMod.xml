Welcome to the Asia Mod. 

This is the fourth version of the Asia Mod. In this version we have concentrated on adapting to version 1 of the vanilla, but there are also a few changes to the gameplay. If there are any small bugs, please let us know. There is a bug report section in our Discord and we will keep you informed about updates and changes there.

All original buildings were removed and replaced by us with suitable Asian buildings. In this version, maps can be generated by the players themselves. We have therefore refrained from delivering pre-made maps. Although we have created around 40 new buildings, there can still be a lot of repetition of POIs on the map. 

We hope that you like our work in which we have invested a lot of heart and passion.

Banzai. Giving up is not an option.
