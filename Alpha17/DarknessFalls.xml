			<Description>
This is a mod I originally created to fix a few "issues" myself, my wife and some friends felt the game had. Turns out I really enjoy modding so I've expanded on it quite a bit.

60 Slot Bigger back pack! 
Features.

8 Classes to choose from, with 6 quests each! (Class quests take approx 60 mins to finish if you grind hard)
Rewritten progression system compared to A17.
Return of Action Skills!
12 slot crafting queue!
Custom UI. Health and Stamina on the left of the toolbelt, Food and Water on the right.
