			<Description>
Experimental mod to improve performance. 			

This has the potential to drastically improve your FPS in-game, at the expense of using legacy distant terrain. Jumps of up to 30 to 60 FPS has been experienced. This is NOT an EAC safe mod.

This version also turns all Terrain Textures to low ( you probably won't notice, but your FPS will thank you )
